            <h3>Here are the top 5 reasons why Christian Bale was best suited to portray <i>The Batman</i>:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Portrays Bruce Learning From Trauma:</dt>
                    <dd>The Nolan films incorporate something comic books will never really do;
                    the idea of growing up and moving on. Bruce undergoes character development
                    and is able to move on from Gotham and the need to be Batman.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Portrays A Skilled Fighter:</dt>
                    <dd>The action scenes in Bale's Batman films are the best and remarkably well done
                    as it is clear that he's skilled in different martial arts styles.
                    </dd>
                <dt>"No Kill" Rule Acted Well:</dt>
                    <dd>The rule of not killing anyone is one of Batman's firmest tenets (though it has
                    been broken before). However, in this series, he maintains it. Bale's excellent
                    acting allows him to humanize this decision.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Humanized Character:</dt>
                    <dd>Since this series is very realistic in how it told its story, Bruce feels very human.
                    Bale is personable as Bruce Wayne. As a college student, he isn't able to go through with  
                    killing Joe Chill. Bruce makes it clear throughout his adventures that he mainly wants to
                    help Gotham, and save it from itself or other outside forces such as the League of Shadows.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Realistic Manner Of Achieving Weapons:</dt>
                    <dd>One question asked often about Batman is: "Where did he get all that tech without anyone
                    noticing?" Nolan came up with a clever solution. William Earle, who assigns Lucius Fox
                    in the R&D department, doesn't care much about what's going on there. So Bruce puts
                    Lucius Fox for developing Bruce's custom equipments. 
                    </dd>
                <dt>Revitalized Comic Book Character: </dt>
                    <dd>Bale and Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen again for a solid realistic origin
                    story. This series was the start of superhero movies coming back into vogue, a trend that
                    continues to current day.
